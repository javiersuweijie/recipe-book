1. Wash and scrub the lotus root thoroughly. Peel if desired, then slice or cube as preferred.

2. In a large pot, bring 6-8 cups (1.5-2 liters) of water to a boil. Add smashed garlic and ginger.

3. Parboil the lotus root in boiling water for 5 minutes to remove excess starch, then drain and set aside.

4. Add your choice of protein (pork ribs, chicken, or chicken/pork mix) to the pot. Parboil for 5 minutes, then drain and rinse under cold water to remove impurities.

5. Return the protein to the pot along with the parboiled lotus root, fish balls, and dried dates. Season with salt, white pepper, and soy sauce.

6. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer. Let it cook for 40-60 minutes, or until the lotus root is tender.

7. Taste and adjust seasoning as needed.

8. Serve hot, garnished with green onions or your preferred herbs.

Optional: For a slow cooker method, transfer all ingredients to a slow cooker after step 5 and cook on low for 2-3 hours.
