1. Blanch the pork ribs in boiling water for a few minutes to remove impurities, then drain well.

2. Heat a pan over medium heat and add sugar. Caramelize the sugar until it turns dark brown.

3. Add the pork ribs to the caramelized sugar and toss evenly to coat.

4. Add the chopped shallots and garlic, and stir-fry until fragrant.

5. Add the spicy broad bean paste, black vinegar, white rice wine, oyster sauce, light soy sauce, and dark soy sauce. Stir well to combine.

6. Add enough water to cover the ribs and bring to a boil.

7. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 1-1.5 hours, or until the ribs are tender.

8. Add brown sugar to balance the flavors and simmer for another 10-15 minutes.

9. Garnish with chopped spring onions and serve hot with steamed rice.
