1. Prepare aromatics: Cut scallions into 2-inch lengths, julienne them. Thinly slice 15g of ginger and julienne. Chop cilantro roughly. Set aside 1/3 of each for later use.

2. Mix sauce: Combine soy sauce, salt, sugar, and hot water in a bowl. Stir until sugar and salt dissolve. Set aside.

3. Set up steamer: Use a wok, pot, or metal steamer with 1-2 inches of water. Bring to a boil.

4. Steam fish: Place fish on a heat-proof plate in the steamer. Cover and steam over medium heat for 7-10 minutes, adjusting time for thickness.

5. Drain liquid: After steaming, carefully drain any liquid from the plate.

6. Add aromatics: Spread 1/3 of the scallions, ginger, and cilantro over the fish.

7. Prepare sauce: Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a wok or saucepan. Add remaining ginger and fry for 1 minute. Add white scallion parts for 30 seconds, then the rest with cilantro until sizzling.

8. Combine sauce: Pour the soy sauce mixture into the wok. Bring to a bubble and cook until wilted, about 30 seconds.

9. Finish dish: Pour sauce over fish. Optionally, add raw aromatics and pour hot oil over them for extra flavor.

10. Serve immediately with steamed rice.
