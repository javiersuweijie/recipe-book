1. **To Make the Chicken:**
   - Wash the chicken clean and set aside the piece of chicken fat from the cavity.
   - Pat the chicken dry with a paper towel and rub lightly with salt.
   - Bring the water, ginger, and scallions to a boil in a large stockpot.
   - Carefully lower the chicken into the boiling water, breast-side up. Adjust the water level so the chicken breast just pokes above the water.
   - Let the water come back to a boil, then carefully lift the chicken out to pour out the colder water trapped in the cavity. Lower the chicken back into the pot.
   - Bring the water to a boil again, then reduce the heat to a simmer. Cover the pot and cook for about 30-35 minutes, roughly 10-11 minutes per pound.
   - Prepare a large ice bath. Once the chicken is cooked, carefully lift it out of the pot, drain the water from the cavity, and lower it into the ice bath for 15 minutes.

2. **To Make the Rice:**
   - While the chicken is cooling, heat the chicken fat and oil in a wok or large skillet over medium heat until fragrant.
   - Add the minced garlic and fry briefly until aromatic.
   - Add the uncooked rice and stir continuously for about two minutes.
   - Transfer the rice to a rice cooker and add the chicken stock until it reaches the '4' line (3 US cups = 4 rice cooker cups). Stir in the salt and cook.
   - If you don’t have a rice cooker, transfer the toasted rice to a medium/large pot, add 4 cups of chicken stock and the salt, soak for 20 minutes, then cover and cook on low heat for 15 minutes.

3. **To Make the Ginger-Garlic Sauce:**
   - Grind the ginger and garlic in a food processor until finely minced.
   - Heat the oil in a small pot or saucepan and gently fry the mixture until aromatic and lightly caramelized.
   - Add salt to taste and transfer to a sauce dish.

4. **To Make the Sweet Dark Soy Sauce:**
   - Heat the water and sugar in a small saucepan over medium heat, stirring until the sugar dissolves and the liquid thickens.
   - Add the dark soy sauce, stir to combine, and transfer to a sauce dish.

5. **To Make the Chili Sauce:**
   - Grind the chilies, ginger, and garlic in a food processor until finely chopped.
   - Add the sesame oil, salt, sugar, lime juice, and vinegar to the food processor and pulse to combine.
   - Transfer to a small bowl and add chicken broth 1 tablespoon at a time until the desired consistency is achieved.

6. **To Serve:**
   - Carve the cooled chicken and serve with the fragrant rice and the three sauces on the side. Enjoy each bite of chicken with a bit of rice and your preferred sauce.
