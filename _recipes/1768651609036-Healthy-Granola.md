1. Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.

2. In a large bowl, combine oats, nuts/seeds, salt, and cinnamon. Stir to blend.

3. Pour in oil, maple syrup/honey, and vanilla. Mix until everything is lightly coated.

4. Spread granola in an even layer on prepared pan. Bake for 21-24 minutes, stirring halfway. For clumpy granola, press down after stirring.

5. Let cool completely (at least 45 minutes). Add dried fruit and optional chocolate chips. Break into chunks or stir for looser granola.
