title: Nikujaga
description: A traditional Japanese beef and potato stew
servings: 4
prep_time: 20 minutes
cook_time: 30 minutes
ingredients:
  - 300g beef (sliced thinly)
  - 2 medium potatoes (peeled and cubed)
  - 1 onion (sliced)
  - 2 cloves garlic (minced)
  - 2 tablespoons soy sauce
  - 2 tablespoons sake (or dry white wine)
  - 1 tablespoon sugar

notes:
  - Use an otoshibuta (Japanese drop lid) if available for even cooking
  - Letting the dish rest before serving enhances flavor absorption

1. Cook the Nikujaga as directed until the flavors are fully developed.

2. Turn off the heat and remove the otoshibuta. Allow the dish to rest, uncovered, for 30â€“60 minutes to let the flavors soak into the ingredients.

3. When ready to serve, add the blanched snow peas to the pot and cover. Reheat over medium heat until simmering.

4. Reduce the heat and let it simmer for a few minutes to ensure the snow peas retain their bright color.

5. Turn off the heat and serve the Nikujaga in a large serving bowl or individual bowls, ensuring each portion includes some of the cooking liquid.
