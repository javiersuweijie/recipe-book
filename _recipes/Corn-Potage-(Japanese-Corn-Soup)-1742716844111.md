1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Place corn cobs in and cook for 5-8 minutes, until the corn is vibrant in color. Drain the corn and let it cool.

2. Once cooled, shave the corn kernels off the cob using a knife.

3. Add the corn kernels and soy milk to a high-speed blender. Blend on high for about 1 minute until smooth.

4. Place a fine mesh sieve over a large bowl or pot. Pour half of the corn soup into the sieve and use a spatula to help the soup pass through. Repeat with the remaining half.

5. Serve the soup at room temperature, heated on the stove over low heat, or chilled in the fridge for about 1 hour. Garnish with fresh parsley, croutons, or soy cream if desired.
