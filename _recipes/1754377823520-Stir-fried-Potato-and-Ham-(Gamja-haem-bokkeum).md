1. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and add the vegetable oil, potato, and garlic. Stir with a wooden spoon for 2 to 3 minutes until the potato looks slightly translucent and the garlic turns crispy and fragrant.

2. Reduce the heat to medium and add the onion, ham, and carrot. Keep stirring for 2 to 3 minutes until the onion looks semi-translucent.

3. Reduce the heat to low and add the water, soy sauce, and sugar. Stir a couple of times and cover. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes until the potato is fully cooked but not mushy.

4. Uncover and turn up the heat to high. Gently stir with a wooden spoon until the juice is evaporated and the potato looks shiny. Be careful not to crush the potato chunks.

5. Remove from the heat and gently stir in the sesame oil.

6. Serve immediately as a side dish for rice, or pack it as a side dish in a Korean lunchbox (dosirak).
