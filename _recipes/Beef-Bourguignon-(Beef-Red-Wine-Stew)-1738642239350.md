1. Cut the beef into 4cm cubes. Slice the onion, carrot, and celery thinly. Crush the garlic cloves.

2. In a large ziplock bag, combine the beef, onion, carrot, celery, garlic, bouquet garni, black peppercorns, and 500ml of red wine. Seal the bag and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 6 hours.

3. Remove the beef and vegetables from the marinade, reserving the liquid. Pat dry the beef with paper towels.

4. In a large Dutch oven or heavy pot, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the beef and sear until browned on all sides, about 5-7 minutes. Remove the beef and set aside.

5. Add the vegetable oil to the pot and saut√© the marinated vegetables (onion, carrot, celery, and garlic) for about 6 minutes until softened.

6. Add the flour to the pot and stir for 1-2 minutes to coat the vegetables evenly.

7. Gradually add the reserved marinade liquid, stirring continuously to avoid lumps. Bring the mixture to a simmer.

8. Add the water, beef stock cube, browned beef, tomato paste, salt, and pepper. Stir well to combine.

9. Bring the stew to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 70 minutes.

10. Add the pearl onions and mushrooms to the pot. Pour in the remaining 100ml of red wine. Continue to simmer, uncovered, for another 30 minutes, or until the meat is tender and the sauce has thickened.

11. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper as needed.

12. Serve hot, garnished with fresh parsley if desired.
