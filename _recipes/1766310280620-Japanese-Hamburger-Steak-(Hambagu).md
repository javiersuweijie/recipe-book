title: Japanese Hamburger Steak (Hambagu)
description: Juicy, tender Japanese-style hamburger steaks served with a rich red wine reduction sauce.
servings: 4
prep_time: 30 minutes
cook_time: 20 minutes
ingredients:
  - "Hambagu Patties":
    - ½ onion (5 oz, 142 g), finely minced
    - 1 Tbsp neutral oil
    - ¾ lb (340 g) ground beef & pork mix (2:1 or 3:1 ratio)
    - ½ tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt
    - freshly ground black pepper, to taste
    - ½ tsp nutmeg
    - ⅓ cup (30 g) panko
    - 2 Tbsp milk
    - 1 large egg (50 g)
  - "For Cooking":
    - 1 Tbsp neutral oil
    - 3 Tbsp red wine (or beef/chicken stock)
  - "Red Wine Reduction Sauce":
    - 1 Tbsp unsalted butter
    - 3 Tbsp ketchup
    - 3 Tbsp tonkatsu sauce (or Worcestershire + pinch sugar)
    - 3 Tbsp red wine (or beef/chicken stock)
    - 3 Tbsp water
notes:
  - Patties must rest 30 min in fridge before cooking so fats firm up and patties hold together.
  - Toss each portion hand-to-hand 5 times to expel air and prevent cracking.
  - Indent patty centers with fingertips; they expand while cooking.
  - Sauce is built in the same pan—don’t rinse it out after searing.
  - Leftover cooked patties keep 3 days refrigerated or 1 month frozen.

1. Mince onion finely. Heat 1 Tbsp oil in a large pan over medium heat; sauté onion until translucent. Cool completely.

2. In a bowl combine cooled onion, ground meats, salt, pepper, nutmeg, panko, milk, and egg. Knead by hand until pale and sticky. Divide into 4 portions (113 g each). Toss each portion hand-to-hand 5 times to release air; form oval patties. Chill 30 min.

3. Heat 1 Tbsp oil in the same pan over medium. Indent centers of patties with fingertips; sear 3 min per side until browned.

4. Add 3 Tbsp red wine, cover, reduce heat to low, and steam 5–7 min until juices run clear. Remove lid, increase heat to evaporate remaining liquid; transfer patties to plates.

5. Sauce: melt 1 Tbsp butter in the same pan. Stir in ketchup, tonkatsu sauce, 3 Tbsp wine, and 3 Tbsp water; simmer until thick enough to draw a line with a spatula.

6. Drizzle sauce over patties; serve extra in a small bowl. Accompany with steamed rice, miso soup, and vegetables if desired.
