1. Boil the pork belly in water for 5 minutes, then remove and pat dry.

2. Make shallow slits on the skin side, brush with vinegar, and generously salt the skin to draw out moisture.

3. Place pork belly skin-side up in the air fryer basket. Cook at 100째C (212째F) for 30 minutes.

4. Increase temperature to 200째C (392째F) and cook for an additional 20 minutes until skin is crispy and golden.

5. While pork is cooking, prepare the dipping sauce by combining chopped cilantro, minced garlic, minced shallots, fish sauce, sugar, lime juice, vinegar, and toasted rice powder in a bowl.

6. Let pork rest for 5 minutes before slicing. Serve hot with the dipping sauce on the side.
