1. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium to high heat. Season both sides of salmon with salt and pepper.
2. Add salmon to the skillet and cook for 1 to 2 minutes per side, until golden brown.
3. While the salmon is cooking, whisk together honey, vinegar, and red pepper flakes in a small bowl.
4. Add the vinegar mixture to the skillet and simmer until the fish is fork-tender and the liquid reduces and thickens, about 5 minutes.
5. For a thicker sauce, simmer for an additional 5 to 10 minutes, removing the salmon if necessary to prevent overcooking.
6. Plate the salmon and serve with your choice of sides.
