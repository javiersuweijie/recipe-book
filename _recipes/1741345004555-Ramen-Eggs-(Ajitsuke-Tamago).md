    - ¼ cup (60ml) mirin
    - ¼ cup (60ml) sake (or water)

1. In a small saucepan, combine soy sauce, mirin, sake (or water), and sugar. Bring to a boil, whisking to dissolve the sugar, then simmer for 1 minute. Let cool completely.

2. Add 4 cups (1L) of water to a medium saucepan and bring to a boil. Gently place the eggs into the boiling water using a mesh strainer or ladle. Cook for 7 minutes for a custardy yolk.

3. Immediately transfer the eggs to an ice water bath and let them chill for 15 minutes to stop the cooking process.

4. Once cooled, crack the eggs at the wide end and peel vertically, dipping them in the ice water to aid peeling.

5. Place the peeled eggs in a plastic bag and cover with the cooled marinade. Seal the bag, removing as much air as possible, and refrigerate for at least 8 hours or overnight.

6. To serve, remove the eggs from the marinade and cut them in half lengthwise. Enjoy as a topping for ramen, in a bento, or as a snack sprinkled with furikake or shichimi togarashi.
