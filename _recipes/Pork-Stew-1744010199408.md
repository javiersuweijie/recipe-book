cook_time: 1 hour 30 minutes
ingredients:
  - "Pork Coating":
    - 0.56 kg pork shoulder, trimmed of visible fat, cut into 1 inch cubes
    - 31.25 g all-purpose flour
    - Salt to taste
    - Black pepper to taste
  - 1-2 tablespoons vegetable oil
  - 2 slices bacon, chopped
  - 0.5 large onion, diced
  - 0.5 tablespoon garlic, minced
  - 128 g carrots, cut into 1/2 inch pieces
  - 50.5 g celery, chopped
  - 59.14 ml white wine
  - 473.17 ml beef broth
  - 1 tablespoon tomato paste
  - 0.5 teaspoon dried thyme leaves
  - 0.25 teaspoon dried rosemary leaves
  - 1 bay leaf
  - 43.5 g pitted prunes, chopped
  - 1 russet potato, peeled and cubed
  - 66.5 g parsnips, peeled and diced
  - Garnish (optional):
    - 1-1.5 tablespoons parsley, chopped
notes:
  - Use a large pot with a heavy bottom to prevent burning.
  - Deglazing the pan is important for flavor, as it pulls up the browned bits (fond) from the bottom.
  - Bacon drippings add flavor, but you can substitute with olive or vegetable oil if preferred.
  - Vegetable amounts and types can be adjusted based on preference or availability.

1. In a mixing bowl, toss the pork cubes with flour, salt, and black pepper to coat evenly, shaking off excess.

2. Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Brown the pork in batches without crowding, about 7-9 minutes. Add more oil as needed. Transfer browned meat to a bowl and set aside. Discard pan drippings.

3. Cook the bacon in the same pot, stirring frequently, until crispy. Transfer to the bowl with the pork.

4. Reduce heat to medium and saut√© the onion, garlic, carrots, and celery in bacon drippings, stirring occasionally, until soft.

5. Add the white wine to the pot and simmer, scraping up the browned bits from the bottom. Continue until the liquid is almost evaporated.

6. Add the beef broth, tomato paste, browned pork, bacon, thyme, rosemary, bay leaf, salt, and black pepper. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and simmer, covered, for 45 minutes.

7. Stir in the prunes, potatoes, and parsnips. Cover and cook for another 45 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking. If the stew is too thick, add more beef broth or water. Adjust salt and pepper as needed.

8. Ladle into individual bowls, garnish with parsley, and serve.
