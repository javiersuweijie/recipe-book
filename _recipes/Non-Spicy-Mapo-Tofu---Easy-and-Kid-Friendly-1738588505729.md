servings: 4
prep_time: 5 minutes
cook_time: 10 minutes
ingredients:
  - 1 lb soft or medium firm tofu, drained and cut into cubes
  - 1 clove garlic, minced
  - ½ tablespoon ginger, minced
  - ¼ lb ground pork
  - 1 stalk scallion, chopped with green parts separated from the white
  - ¾ cup chicken stock
  - Sauce ingredients:
    - 1 tablespoon bean sauce
    - 1 tablespoon oyster sauce
    - 1 tablespoon soy sauce
    - 1 tablespoon Shaoxing wine
    - 1 tablespoon black vinegar
  - Cornstarch slurry:
    - 1 tablespoon cornstarch
    - 1 tablespoon water
notes: |
  - This recipe can be adapted to suit various tastes. For a spicy version, add chili paste, chili sauce, or fresh/dried chilis.
  - For a vegetarian option, omit the ground pork and replace chicken stock with water or vegetable stock.
  - To make more sauce, add an extra cup of chicken stock.

1. In a small bowl, mix together the sauce ingredients and set aside.
2. In a separate bowl, mix together cornstarch and water for the cornstarch slurry. Set aside.
3. Heat up a wok or sauté pan over high heat and add 1 tablespoon of oil. Turn the heat down to medium and add ginger. Sauté for about 10 seconds, just long enough to release its aroma.
4. Add ground pork and garlic then use the spatula to break up the pork into small pieces. Once the pork is nicely browned, toss in the white parts of the scallions.
5. Stir in the sauce and sauté until it becomes very fragrant.
6. Add tofu and gently incorporate it into the sauce. Be careful not to break up the tofu.
7. Add chicken stock then turn up the heat and bring it to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium and let it simmer until the tofu is heated through. Stir occasionally, again being careful not to break up the tofu.
8. Give the cornstarch slurry a good mix. Push the tofu to the side and gently stir in half the cornstarch mixture. Allow it to return to a boil. You'll notice the sauce has thickened. Repeat with another tablespoon of cornstarch slurry until you reach your desired consistency.
9. Sprinkle green parts of the scallions over the top and serve.
