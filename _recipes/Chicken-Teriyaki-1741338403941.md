1. In a small microwave-safe bowl, combine the teriyaki sauce ingredients: soy sauce, mirin, sake, and sugar. Microwave until hot, mix well to dissolve the sugar, and set aside.

2. Prepare the chicken by placing it smooth side down and scoring it to ensure even thickness. Make slits every ½ inch (1.3 cm) without cutting all the way through. Press open and flatten the meat with your fingers, ensuring even thickness.

3. Lightly season the chicken with kosher salt and black pepper.

4. Heat a large frying pan over medium-high heat. Add neutral oil, then place the chicken smooth side down. Cook for 5 minutes, pressing down with a spatula for 5–10 seconds to sear the presentation side.

5. Flip the chicken, press down again with the spatula, then reduce heat to low, cover, and steam for 3 minutes.

6. Remove the lid, wipe excess grease with a paper towel, then add the teriyaki sauce. Tilt the pan and spoon the sauce frequently over the chicken until well-coated and cooked through.

7. Transfer the chicken to a cutting board. Reduce the sauce to your desired consistency, then transfer it to a bowl.

8. Slice the chicken into bite-sized pieces and serve on a plate with the sauce drizzled on top. Optionally, serve over steamed rice with a side of green salad and tomato wedges.

9. For extra flavor, sear the chicken with a kitchen butane torch or under a broiler before serving.
