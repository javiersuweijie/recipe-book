1. Slice the zucchinis into rounds (about 1/3-inch thickness). Lightly salt both sides and set aside until softened and some moisture is released, about 15 to 20 minutes. Shake off excess moisture.

2. Dredge both sides of each zucchini piece in flour, doing this for all pieces before proceeding.

3. Heat a large non-stick pan with a tablespoon of oil over medium heat. Dip each zucchini piece in the egg wash, then carefully place in the pan.

4. Cook until lightly golden, about 1 minute, depending on thickness and heat. Add a decorative red pepper slice or green leaflet when the egg is almost set.

5. Flip the zucchinis when the bottom edges turn golden, cooking for another minute. Add more oil if needed, but avoid overcooking.

6. Repeat until all pieces are fried, adding a tablespoon of oil each time. Serve warm with the dipping sauce.
