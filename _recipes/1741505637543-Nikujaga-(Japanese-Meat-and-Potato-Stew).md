1. Cut the onion into ½-inch wedges, the carrot into 1-inch pieces using the rangiri technique, and the potatoes into quarters. Soak the potatoes in water to remove starch and remove sharp edges using the mentori technique.

2. Blanch the snow peas in boiling water for 1 minute, then set aside. Blanch the shirataki noodles in boiling water for 1 minute to remove odor, then drain and set aside.

3. Heat 1 Tbsp of neutral oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Sauté the onion wedges, then add the thinly sliced beef and cook until no longer pink.

4. Add the potatoes, carrot, and noodles to the pot, mixing well. Pour in 2 cups of dashi, adding water if necessary to almost cover the ingredients.

5. Cover with a lid and bring to a boil. Skim the scum and foam from the surface.

6. Add 1 Tbsp sugar, 2 Tbsp sake, 4 Tbsp soy sauce, and 4 Tbsp mirin. Mix well, then place an otoshibuta on top.

7. Simmer on low heat for 12–14 minutes, or until a skewer pierces a potato easily. Do not mix the ingredients while cooking.

8. Turn off the heat and let rest for 30–60 minutes. Add the blanched snow peas, cover, and reheat on medium heat for a few minutes before serving.

9. Serve the Nikujaga in a large serving bowl or individual bowls with some cooking liquid.
