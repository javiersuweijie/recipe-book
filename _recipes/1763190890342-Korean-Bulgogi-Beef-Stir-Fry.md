title: Korean Bulgogi Beef Stir Fry
description: A classic Korean dish with sweet and salty marinated beef, quick and easy to make
servings: 2-3
prep_time: 15 minutes
cook_time: 5 minutes
ingredients:
  - "Beef":
    - 14 oz (400g) thinly sliced beef, any good quality tender cut suitable for grilling
    - 1 scallion/shallot stem, green and white part separated, both finely sliced
    - 1/2 large onion (brown, yellow or white), peeled and thinly sliced
    - 1/2 medium carrot, peeled, cut vertically then cut into thin slices on the diagonal
    - 1 tbsp cooking oil (I use peanut or vegetable oil)
    - 1/2 tbsp sesame seeds
  - "Marinade":
    - 3 tbsp ordinary soy sauce (I use Kikkoman)
    - 1 1/2 tbsp brown sugar
    - 1 tbsp mirin
    - 1/2 tbsp sesame oil
    - 2 tbsp grated onion (brown, white or yellow)
    - 2 cloves garlic, minced
    - 3 tbsp grated red apple (not green - they are too tart) OR nashi pears
    - 1/2 tsp minced ginger
    - Black pepper
notes:
  - You can substitute mirin with dry sherry or sake + 1/2 tsp of sugar. If you cannot have alcohol in your cooking, substitute with 1 tsp apple cider vinegar + 1/2 tsp sugar.
  - Rump, flank, sirloin, t-bone and scotch fillet are excellent cuts for this recipe. Slice the beef against the grain for more tender meat.

1. Blot the beef dry using a paper towel then place into a bowl.

2. Mix together the Marinade ingredients in a small bowl, then add the beef. Stir gently to coat the beef, cover with cling wrap and set aside to marinate for at least 1 hour, preferably overnight.

3. Heat the oil in a wok or large fry pan over high heat.

4. Add the onion and white part of the scallion/shallots. Cook for 1 minute.

5. Then add the beef, including the Marinade, and carrots. Cook for around 3 to 5 minutes, stirring constantly, until the beef is just cooked.

6. Remove from heat, then toss through the sesame seeds.

7. Serve immediately with rice - or for a low carb, low cal option, try Cauliflower Rice! Sprinkle with extra sesame seeds and the reserved green part of the scallions.
