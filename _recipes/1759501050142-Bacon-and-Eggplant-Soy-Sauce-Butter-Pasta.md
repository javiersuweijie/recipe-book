1. Gather all ingredients and prepare the cooking pot. Add 4 QT water to a large pot and bring to a boil.

2. Crush or mince 2 cloves garlic. Slice 1 dried red chili pepper into thin rounds. Cut ½ onion into ¼-inch slices. Remove stems from 3 shiitake mushrooms and slice caps into ½-inch slices. Mince chives for garnish.

3. Cut 4 slices applewood smoked bacon into 1-inch pieces. Just before cooking, cut the eggplant right before cooking to prevent discoloration.

4. Boil the spaghetti: Add 1½ Tbsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt to boiling water, then add 8 oz spaghetti. Cook until al dente, about 1 minute less than package instructions.

5. Cook the ingredients: Heat a frying pan on medium heat. Add 2 Tbsp olive oil, then the bacon. Sauté until edges crisp, then add onion.

6. While sautéing, cut eggplant into ⅓-inch slices. Stir in garlic and chili pepper. Add eggplant, season with salt and pepper, toss to coat.

7. Add mushrooms, cover, reduce heat to low, and steam for 3 minutes.

8. Toss pasta: Transfer al dente pasta to frying pan with butter and soy sauce. Toss well, adding pasta water if needed.

9. Serve: Garnish with minced chives and serve immediately.

10. Store leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days or freezer for a month.
