1. Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.

2. In a frying pan, combine panko, olive oil, garlic powder, and dried thyme. Toast over medium heat until golden brown. Transfer to a shallow dish and let cool.

3. Cut the salmon into 2-inch (5cm) wide blocks, then slice diagonally into ½-inch (1.3cm) thick pieces. Season both sides with salt and pepper.

4. Set up three shallow dishes: one with flour, one with the beaten egg, and one with the toasted panko.

5. Dredge each salmon piece in flour, shaking off excess. Dip into the egg, then coat thoroughly with panko, pressing gently to adhere.

6. Arrange the coated salmon nuggets on the prepared baking sheet.

7. Bake for 15–20 minutes, checking at 15 minutes, until the salmon is just cooked through.

8. Serve hot with ketchup or Homemade Tartar Sauce and a squeeze of fresh lemon juice.
