1. Gather all the ingredients. If preferred, the sauce can be made from scratch.

2. Cut 1½ onions into thin wedges.

3. Trim the stem ends from 4 cremini mushrooms and slice the caps thinly.

4. Cut 10 oz of thinly sliced beef into 2-inch sections.

5. Heat a medium pot over medium heat. Add 1 Tbsp unsalted butter. Once melted, add the onions and season with Diamond Crystal kosher salt. Sauté for 5 minutes until slightly wilted.

6. Add the beef to the pot, seasoning with Diamond Crystal kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper. Stir and cook for 2–3 minutes until the meat is no longer pink.

7. Add the mushrooms and stir to combine. Then, add 1¾ cups of water.

8. Increase the heat to high, cover the pot, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to maintain a simmer and cook for 20 minutes, occasionally skimming off any scum.

9. Turn off the heat. Dissolve 1–2 cubes of Hayashi Rice Sauce (Roux) in a ladleful of cooking liquid, then stir into the pot. Repeat until all the roux is incorporated.

10. Turn the heat to medium and cook for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.

11. Divide 4 servings of cooked Japanese short-grain rice on one side of shallow bowls. Ladle the hayashi rice sauce on the other side and serve.
