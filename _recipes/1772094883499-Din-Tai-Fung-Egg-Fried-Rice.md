title: Din Tai Fung Egg Fried Rice
description: A simple yet delicious egg fried rice inspired by Din Tai Fung.
servings: 2
prep_time: 10 minutes
cook_time: 15 minutes
ingredients:
  - 5 whole eggs
  - 1 tsp white pepper [5g]
  - ½ tbsp salt [7.5g]
  - 5 tbsp cooking oil [75ml]
  - white parts of green onion
  - cold cooked rice
  - 1-1.5 tbsp sugar [15-22.5g]
  - 1.5 tbsp chicken powder or mushroom powder [22.5g]
  - 1.5 tbsp Soy Sauce [22.5ml]
  - ½ tbsp salt [7.5g]
  - green onion [for garnish]
notes:
  - The perfect balance for fried rice in Asian restaurants is a 1:1:0.5 ratio of salt, sugar, and MSG.
  - The sugar helps balance out the salt, which allows the dish to feel more well-rounded.
  - Rather than using straight MSG, Chicken Powder or Mushroom Powder can be used. However, keep in mind that Chicken Powder and Mushroom Powder contains salt; therefore, the ratio for salt is lowered to prevent the dish from becoming overly salty.
