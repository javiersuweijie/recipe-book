1. In a small saucepan, combine all the teriyaki sauce ingredients until the sugar is fully dissolved. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat and allow the sauce to thicken.

2. Once thickened, remove from heat and pour into a wide container. Let it cool down completely in the freezer until it reaches room temperature, about 5 minutes.

3. Marinate the salmon filets in the teriyaki sauce for 15 minutes at room temperature.

4. Place the marinated salmon filets skin side down in the air fryer basket in a single layer without overlapping. Brush a thin layer of the marinade on top of the salmon.

5. Air fry at 400°F (200°C) for 7-9 minutes until cooked through or until an internal temperature of 145°F (63°C) is reached. Do not overcook; check at the 7-minute mark.

6. Garnish with green onions and sesame seeds. Optional: reheat the leftover teriyaki sauce and serve as a finishing sauce.

*To bake:*
- Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Place the marinated salmon skin side down on a greased baking dish or parchment-lined tray. Brush with more marinade and bake for 12-15 minutes until cooked through.

*To pan-fry:*
- Heat 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of vegetable oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Cook the salmon skin side up for 3-4 minutes until golden, then flip and cook for another 3-4 minutes until cooked through. Pour in remaining marinade in the last 30 seconds.
