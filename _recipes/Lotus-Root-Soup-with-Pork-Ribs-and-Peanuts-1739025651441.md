1. Wash and prepare the lotus root by peeling and cutting into rounds. Rinse under cold water to remove any excess starch.

2. Blanch the pork ribs in boiling water for 5 minutes to remove impurities. Drain and set aside.

3. In a large pot, combine pork ribs, lotus root, peanuts, dried scallops, red dates, and squid. Pour in the water and bring to a boil.

4. Once boiling, reduce the heat to a simmer and cook for 1-1.5 hours, or until the lotus root and peanuts are tender.

5. Add arrowroot (if using) during the last 30 minutes of cooking.

6. Season with salt to taste before serving.

7. Serve hot as a main soup or with steamed rice.
