1. Rinse wood ear mushrooms, dried lily flowers, and shiitake mushrooms separately under running water. Trim tough mushroom stems. Soak each in hot water for 2 hours, covering with plates to ensure rehydration.

2. After soaking, chop wood ears, slice mushrooms into quarter-inch thick pieces, and trim the tough bottom portion of lily flowers.

3. In a bowl, combine chicken, wood ears, mushrooms, lily flowers, water or stock, vegetable oil, sesame oil, rice wine (if using), oyster sauce, sugar, salt, white pepper, ginger, and the white portions of scallions. Mix until chicken absorbs most liquid. Cover and marinate for at least 2 hours or overnight.

4. Before cooking, let the chicken mixture reach room temperature (1-2 hours). Add cornstarch and mix until well incorporated, ensuring no standing liquid remains.

5. Transfer the mixture to a deep heatproof plate in a single layer. Sprinkle half the green scallions on top.

6. Place the dish in a covered pre-heated steamer with boiling water. Steam over medium-high heat for 10 minutes, then shut off the heat and let it rest, covered, for another 2 minutes.

7. Carefully remove the dish without dripping condensation onto it. Sprinkle the remaining green scallions on top.

8. Serve immediately with steamed rice.
