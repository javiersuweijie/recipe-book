1. Marinate the Beef & Mushrooms: In a bowl, combine the beef strips, shiitake mushrooms, 1 minced garlic clove, 1 tsp sugar, 2 tsp soy sauce, 1 tsp sesame oil, and ¼ tsp black pepper. Mix well, cover, and refrigerate.

2. Make the Egg Garnish: Beat the egg yolk with a pinch of salt. Heat a non-stick pan over medium with 1 tsp vegetable oil. Wipe the pan to leave a thin, even layer. Turn off the heat. Pour the yolk into the pan, tilting to form a thin sheet. Cook for 1 minute using residual heat. Flip and cook for 1 more minute. Remove, let cool, and slice into thin strips.

3. Prepare Spinach & Noodles: Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Blanch the spinach for 30-60 seconds, then rinse in cold water. Squeeze out excess water, cut it, and place in a bowl. Mix with 1 tsp soy sauce and 1 tsp sesame oil. Transfer to a large mixing bowl. In the same boiling water, cook the noodles for about 8 minutes until tender. Drain and cut with scissors. Add to the large bowl with the spinach. Mix in 2 tsp sesame oil, 1 tsp soy sauce, and 1 tsp sugar. Set aside.

4. Stir-Fry Vegetables & Meat: Stir-fry each ingredient separately in a skillet with a little vegetable oil and a pinch of salt, transferring each to the large noodle bowl after cooking.
   - Onions & Green Onions: Stir-fry for 2 minutes until translucent
   - White Mushrooms: Stir-fry for 2 minutes until softened
   - Carrot & Bell Pepper: Stir-fry for 20-30 seconds until slightly softened
   - Marinated Beef & Mushrooms: Stir-fry for a few minutes until beef is cooked through

5. Combine and Serve: To the large mixing bowl with all the ingredients, add the final seasonings: 1 minced garlic clove, 1 tbsp soy sauce, 1 tbsp sugar, ½ tsp black pepper, and 2 tsp sesame oil. Mix thoroughly by hand. Gently toss in the egg garnish strips and sesame seeds. Transfer to a plate and serve.
