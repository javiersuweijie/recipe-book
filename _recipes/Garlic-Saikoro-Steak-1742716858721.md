1. Prepare the vegetables: grate the daikon radish, drain excess liquid, and set aside. Slice the garlic cloves and green onion for garnish.

2. Trim the beef tenderloin into 1–1½ inch (2.5–3.5 cm) cubes. Season with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper.

3. Heat 1½ Tbsp of neutral oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. Fry garlic slices until golden brown, then transfer to a paper towel to drain. Retain the garlic-infused oil in the pan.

4. Increase the heat to high and add the beef cubes in a single layer. Sear for 1 minute until browned on the bottom, then flip and cook the other side until nicely browned.

5. Add 2 Tbsp of sake to the pan, shaking to distribute evenly. Cook for an additional minute if medium doneness is preferred.

6. Transfer the steak to a plate and top with fried garlic chips, grated daikon, chopped green onion, and Korean chili threads if desired. Pour 3 Tbsp of ponzu over the daikon before serving.
