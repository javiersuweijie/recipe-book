1. Heat sesame oil in a pot over medium-high heat. Add the white parts of the spring onions, shallots, and garlic. Sauté for 30 seconds to 1 minute until fragrant.

2. Increase heat to high, add minced beef, and break it down with a spoon. Cook for 1-2 minutes until no longer pink. Add a touch more sesame oil if the pan becomes dry.

3. Add shimeiji mushrooms and sauté for another minute.

4. Stir in 1 tsp of sugar and 1 tbsp of soy sauce for 1 minute.

5. Remove half of the beef and mushrooms and set aside for topping later.

6. In the same pan, add 6 cups of beef broth, 1 tbsp of fish sauce, and a pinch of MSG. Bring to a boil.

7. While the broth is cooking, boil another pot of water and cook the noodles according to package instructions. Drain and set aside.

8. Once the broth boils, add frozen dumplings. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 5 minutes.

9. Taste and adjust salt if needed.

10. Divide noodles into serving bowls. Add broth according to preference.

11. Top with dumplings, reserved beef and mushrooms, green spring onions, and black pepper to taste.
