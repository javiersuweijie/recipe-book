1. Prepare the vegetables: Halve the onion lengthwise, remove the core, and cut into 6 radial pieces. Slice the carrot into large, diagonal pieces. Thinly slice the garlic, removing the core.

2. Cut the beef into large bite-sized pieces and season with salt and pepper. Cut the bacon into 1cm cubes.

3. Heat olive oil in a pot over medium heat. Add the beef and brown evenly. Add the bacon and continue to brown until fragrant.

4. Add the onion, carrot, and garlic. Saut√© until the oil coats the vegetables. Sprinkle with flour and cook until the rawness is gone.

5. Add the red wine, water, and salt. Stir well and bring to a boil. Remove any scum that rises.

6. Cover the pot, reduce the heat to low, and simmer for 1.5 to 2 hours, stirring occasionally, until the meat is tender.

7. Remove the bouquet garni and stir in the butter until melted. Handle the ingredients gently to prevent breaking.

8. Serve hot and enjoy your Boeuf Bourguignon!
