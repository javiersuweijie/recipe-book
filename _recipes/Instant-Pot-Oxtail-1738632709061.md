1. Brown the oxtails in the Instant Pot using the "Sauté More" function. Heat until it displays "HOT," then add olive oil. Season the oxtails with salt and pepper, and brown each side for 5 minutes.

2. Sauté the sliced onions for 2 minutes, then add tomato paste, bay leaves, oregano, and thyme. Cook for 3 minutes, followed by garlic for another minute.

3. Deglaze the pot with unsalted stock, scrubbing the flavorful brown bits off the bottom.

4. Add balsamic vinegar, soy sauce, and fish sauce. Place the browned oxtails in the pot, ensuring partial submersion. Layer carrots and potatoes on top.

5. Close the lid, set the Venting Knob to Sealing Position, and pressure cook at High Pressure for 40 minutes with a Natural Release of 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, release any remaining pressure.

6. Remove the oxtails and half the carrots. Simmer the sauce, breaking down the potatoes and remaining carrots to thicken it. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

7. Return the oxtails to the sauce and let them sit for 10-15 minutes before serving. Serve immediately or the next day for enhanced flavor.
