1. Preheat a large pot over medium heat. Add 2 Tbsp sesame oil. Add ginger slices and stir fry until fragrant, about 2-3 minutes. Remove the ginger, but don't throw them away.

2. Add the chicken pieces and brown the chicken pieces.

3. Add chicken wine, chicken broth, and the ginger back to the pot. Bring to a boil.

4. Add the pitted dates and partially cover with a lid. Lower the heat and let it gently simmer for 30-40 minutes, depending on the cut of chicken you use. Cook until the chicken pieces are tender and cooked through.

5. Season with a bit of sugar and pinch of salt to your taste. Stir in the rest of the sesame oil if you prefer.

6. You can serve with rice or with a bowl of mee sua noodles. Garnish with chopped green onion and cilantro leaves. Serve warm.
