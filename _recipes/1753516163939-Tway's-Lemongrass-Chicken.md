  - "Marinade":

1. Finely mince the garlic and lemongrass. Slice the bird’s eye chilies (optional) and cut the chicken thighs into bite-sized pieces.

2. In a clean bowl, combine the chicken thighs, minced garlic, minced lemongrass, granulated sugar, fish sauce, and bird’s eye chilies (optional). Massage the marinade into the chicken, wrap it up, and let it sit in the fridge for a minimum of 30 minutes or overnight (the longer, the more flavorful).

3. When ready to cook, add enough oil to coat the pan and heat it over medium-high heat. Once the pan is smoky, add the chicken. Let it sit for 3-4 minutes or until it forms a nice color, then flip and cook for 2-3 more minutes.

4. Remove from heat and serve over rice with your favorite vegetables. Enjoy!
