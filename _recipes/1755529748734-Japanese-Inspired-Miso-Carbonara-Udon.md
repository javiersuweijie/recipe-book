1. In a pan over medium heat, sauté the 200g guanciale for 5–6 minutes until golden and crispy. Remove from heat and set aside, reserving about 2 tablespoons of the rendered fat.

2. In a dry pan, lightly toast the 1 tsp black peppercorns and 1 tsp Sichuan peppercorns until fragrant. Let cool slightly, then grind into a coarse powder.

3. In a large bowl, combine 4 egg yolks, 1 cup grated Parmesan cheese, ground pepper mix, 2 tbsp miso paste, and the reserved guanciale oil. Mix until smooth.

4. Boil the 4 servings of udon noodles according to package instructions. Drain well.

5. Add the hot noodles and crispy guanciale to the bowl with the sauce. Toss quickly to coat the noodles, letting the heat cook the sauce gently into a creamy consistency.

6. Divide into 4 bowls and top with extra Parmesan and freshly ground pepper if desired.
