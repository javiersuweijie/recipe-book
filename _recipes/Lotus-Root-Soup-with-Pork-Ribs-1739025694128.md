1. Soak peanuts in hot water for about 30 minutes. Discard the soaking water after soaking.

2. Blanch pork ribs in a pot of boiling water for about 5 minutes to remove impurities. Remove and set aside.

3. While waiting for the pork ribs, wash, peel, and cut the lotus root into 1 cm slices or irregular bite-sized pieces.

4. In a soup pot, add all the ingredients, including the soaked peanuts, blanched pork ribs, lotus root, carrot, cuttlefish (if using), and red dates.

5. Pour in enough water to cover all ingredients by about 1 to 2 inches.

6. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to the lowest setting and let it simmer for about 2-3 hours, or until the meat is very tender.

7. Season with salt to taste, then serve hot.
