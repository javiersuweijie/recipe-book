1. Heat oil in a pot and fry the thinly sliced shallots until fragrant. Add the anchovies and fry until aromatic.

2. Add 1.5L of water to the pot, bring to a boil, and simmer for 30 minutes to develop the soup base.

3. While the soup is simmering, prepare the garnish ingredients: cut spinach (discarding the stems), slice the mushrooms, and prepare the black fungus.

4. Heat a wok with oil, fry the shallots, then add the minced meat. Sear the meat until browned, flipping over as needed.

5. Add garlic and mushrooms to the wok, stir-frying until fragrant. Add a splash of mushroom liquid and dark soy sauce, then let most of the liquid evaporate. Set aside to cool.

6. Before serving, take the anchovy soup and cook the ban mian noodles in it.

7. Serve the noodles in bowls, topped with the minced meat and garnished with mushrooms, black fungus, and fried shallots.
