1. To make the ginger scallion oil, finely mince the scallions and ginger, then place them in a heat-resistant bowl. Set aside.

2. Use paper towels to absorb moisture from the chicken thighs. Place the chicken on a hot pan skin side down (no oil needed as the skin will release oil while frying). Pan-fry each side for 3-5 minutes until cooked and golden brown. Set aside once done.

3. Heat 3 tablespoons of oil in the same pan, then immediately pour it over the ginger and scallions. Mix in Â½ teaspoon of salt.

4. Boil the instant noodles for 1 minute less than the package instructions, then drain and transfer them to the same pan. Mix in the instant noodle seasoning packet, 1 teaspoon of dark soy sauce, and a bit of water to prevent dryness.

5. Serve the noodles, place the chicken on top, and spoon a portion of the ginger scallion oil over the chicken.
