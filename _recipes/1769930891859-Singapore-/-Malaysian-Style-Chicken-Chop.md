ingredients:

    - ½ teaspoon sugar

    - ⅓ chicken stock cube
    - 8 g plain flour
    - 200 ml water
    - ½ teaspoon dark soy sauce (adjust for colour)
  - "Sides":
    - Store-bought French fries, as desired

1. **Prepare and marinate the chicken**: Butterfly each chicken leg by slicing halfway through the meat while keeping the piece intact. Combine chicken with soy sauce, oyster sauce, sugar, garlic, and white pepper. Mix well, refrigerate for at least 2 hours, then let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes.

2. **Make the gravy**: Melt butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Add black pepper and chicken stock cube, then stir in flour until the mixture turns brown. Gradually add water, stirring until smooth and thickened. Season with dark soy sauce for colour; set aside.

3. **Pan-fry the chicken**: Heat a little oil in a pan over medium heat. Place chicken skin-side down and sear for about 4 minutes per side until the skin is browned and slightly charred and the meat is cooked through.

4. **Prepare the sides**: Deep-fry French fries in hot oil over medium-high heat until crispy and golden; turn heat to high for the last minute to remove excess oil. Deep-fry butter rolls in the same oil until golden.

5. **Serve**: Slice the chicken and plate with fries and fried buns; drizzle with black pepper gravy.
