1. Cut the rack in half between two bones. Remove the silver skin from the bone-side. Separate into individual ribs.

2. In a large bowl whisk egg, 2 Tbsp water, wine, sesame oil and salt. Add ribs, coat well, and marinate 15 min–2 hr at room temperature.

3. **If air-frying**: line the drip tray with foil.  
   **If oven-frying**: set rack in upper third, pre-heat oven to 450 °F / 230 °C (convection if possible). Line a sheet with foil, set a lightly oiled rack on top.

4. Lift ribs out of marinade. To the remaining marinade add flour, cornstarch, white pepper, 2 Tbsp oil, 2 Tbsp water and soy sauce; stir to a slurry. Return ribs and coat evenly.

5. **Air-fry**: Arrange ribs bony-side down in a single layer (work in batches). Air-fry at 400 °F / 200 °C for 10 min. Loosen, flip, and cook 3 min more. Keep finished ribs warm in a low oven while you cook the rest.  
   **Oven-fry**: Arrange ribs bony-side down on the prepared rack. Roast 15 min, loosen, flip, and roast 5 min more until browned.

6. Combine salt, sugar, ¼ tsp white pepper and five-spice in a small bowl. Have it ready by the stove.

7. Place 1½ Tbsp oil and sliced garlic in a wok or large skillet. Heat over medium until garlic is pale gold. Scoop garlic out; pour off oil, leaving just a film.

8. Return pan to high heat. Add jalapeño and Fresno rings; stir-fry 1 min until glossy. Add ribs, stir-fry 1–2 min to heat through. Sprinkle the spice mixture, toss quickly, return garlic, toss again. Transfer to a platter and serve hot.
