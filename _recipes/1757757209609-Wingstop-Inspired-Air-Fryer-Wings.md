1. Prep the Wings: Pat wings extremely dry with paper towels. Rub baking powder onto the skin, then sprinkle salt, garlic powder, and onion powder.

2. Batter Them: Mix all dry batter ingredients in a bowl. Toss wings to coat evenly, shaking off excess batter.

3. Air Fry: Arrange wings in a single layer in the air fryer. Cook at 200°C for 10–12 minutes per side (total 20-24 minutes). Flip halfway through cooking.

4. Sauce It Up:
   - For Kicap Manis Sauce: Combine all sauce ingredients in a bowl. Toss hot wings in the sauce and sprinkle with fried shallots.
   - For Lemon Pepper: Sprinkle lemon pepper seasoning evenly on all sides of the wings while they're hot.
