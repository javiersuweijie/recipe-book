1. Cut 0.75 onion in half, and cut each half into ½-inch (1.3 cm) wedges.

2. Peel 0.75 carrot and cut it into 1-inch (2.5 cm) pieces using a diagonal cutting technique (rangiri) for more surface area.

3. Cut each of the 2.25 Yukon gold potatoes into quarters. Remove sharp edges using a knife (mentori technique) and soak the potatoes in water to remove starch.

4. Remove the strings from 6 pieces snow peas.

5. Blanch the snow peas in a small pot of boiling, salted water for 1 minute, then set aside.

6. Drain and cut 0.75 package shirataki noodles in half. Blanch the noodles in boiling water for 1 minute to remove any odor, then drain well and set aside.

7. Cut the thinly-sliced beef into pieces about 3 inches (7.6 cm) wide.

8. Preheat a large pot or Dutch oven on medium heat. Add 0.75 Tbsp neutral oil and sauté the onion wedges.

9. Add the beef to the pot and cook until no longer pink.

10. Add the potatoes and coat them well with the cooking liquid to prevent breaking.

11. Add the carrot pieces and shirataki noodles, mixing everything together.

12. Pour in 360 ml dashi (Japanese soup stock), adding water if necessary to almost cover the ingredients.

13. Cover with a lid, bring to a boil, then skim the scum and foam from the surface.

14. Add 0.75 Tbsp sugar, 22.5 ml sake, 45 ml soy sauce, and 45 ml mirin. Mix well.

15. Place an otoshibuta (drop lid) on top of the ingredients to maintain their shape and prevent breaking.

16. Simmer on low heat for 12–14 minutes, or until a skewer pierces a potato easily.

17. Serve hot and enjoy!
