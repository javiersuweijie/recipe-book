1. Heat a wok over medium heat and add a little oil. Add the pork ribs, meat side down, and brown for 2 minutes. Flip and brown the other side for another 2 minutes.

2. Add a little more oil, then add the chopped shallots and garlic. Fry until fragrant.

3. Stir in the spicy broad bean paste and cook for a few seconds until aromatic.

4. Add the black vinegar, Chinese rice wine, and mix well.

5. Pour in enough water to cover the ribs and bring to a boil. Add the oyster sauce, light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, and brown sugar. Mix thoroughly.

6. Once boiling, cover the wok, reduce the heat to low, and braise for 30 minutes. Ensure the liquid does not burn off.

7. After 30 minutes, remove the lid, increase the heat to high, and reduce the sauce until it becomes sticky and caramelized, about 10-15 minutes.

8. Serve hot, garnished with chopped spring onions and steamed rice on the side.
