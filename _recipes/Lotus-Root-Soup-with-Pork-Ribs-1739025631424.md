1. Soak the peanuts in boiling water for about 30 minutes. Discard the soaking water after soaking.

2. Blanch the pork ribs in a small pot of boiling water for about 5 minutes to remove impurities. Remove the ribs from the pot and set aside.

3. Wash, peel, and cut the lotus root into 1 cm slices or irregular bite-sized pieces.

4. In a large soup pot, combine all the ingredients, including the prepared lotus root, pork ribs, peanuts, carrot, dried cuttlefish, scallops, and red dates.

5. Add enough water to the pot to submerge all the ingredients by about 1 to 2 inches.

6. Bring the soup to a boil, then reduce the heat to the lowest setting and let it simmer for about 2 to 3 hours, or until the meat is very tender.

7. Season the soup with salt to taste, then serve hot.
