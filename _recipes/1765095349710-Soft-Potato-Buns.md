1. Boil potatoes until tender, drain, peel and mash until very smooth. Cool to lukewarm.

2. Mound flour on a work surface, make a well in the centre and add mashed potato, sugar, oil, yeast and egg.

3. Mix the centre with a fork, then start adding milk a splash at a time, incorporating flour from the sides until a soft dough forms and all milk is used.

4. Sprinkle salt over the dough and knead 5–10 min until smooth and elastic.

5. Cover with an upturned bowl; rest 10 min.

6. Lightly flour the surface, flatten dough into a disc and cut into 12 equal wedges.

7. Stretch and roll each wedge into a ball, pinching the seam to seal.

8. Arrange on an oiled, parchment-lined pan with space between. Cover and proof 40 min.

9. Heat oven to 180°C (350°F). Beat egg with milk; brush over risen buns.

10. Bake 35 min until deep golden. Cool slightly before serving.
