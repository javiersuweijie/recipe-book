1. Gather all the ingredients.

2. Make the bulgogi marinade. In a large bowl, combine 2 Tbsp (30ml) Korean soy sauce, 1 Tbsp (15ml) toasted sesame oil, 1.5 Tbsp (22.5g) brown sugar, and 4 cloves garlic (minced).

3. Grate 0.25 Asian pear (or substitute) into the bowl.

4. Add freshly ground black pepper and mix well.

5. Slice 0.25 onion into thin slices. Cut 1.5 green onions/scallions into 2-inch (5cm) pieces, then halve them lengthwise.

6. Peel 2 inches (5cm) of carrot into thin ribbons or slice thinly. Add the onion, green onions, and carrot to the marinade and mix together.

7. Add 0.75 lb (340g) thinly sliced beef to the marinade, separating each slice. Mix thoroughly to coat the beef. For better mixing, wear plastic gloves and mix by hand.

8. Marinate for at least 30 minutes or overnight (recommended).

9. Heat a large skillet or cast iron grill pan over medium-high heat. Add 0.5 Tbsp (7.5ml) toasted sesame oil.

10. Add the marinated beef in a single layer. Grill until cooked through, about 5 minutes. Transfer the meat to a plate and sprinkle with 0.25 Tbsp toasted white sesame seeds.

11. Serve immediately. For extended warmth, use a single-serving cast iron plate if available. Enjoy with steamed rice and kimchi, or use leftovers in onigirazu.
