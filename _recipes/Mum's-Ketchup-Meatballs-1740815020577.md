1. In a large mixing bowl, combine minced pork, salt, sesame oil, black pepper, minced onion, and cornstarch. Mix well until just combined. If using egg, add it to the mixture and incorporate.

2. Use your hands to shape the mixture into small, round meatballs.

3. Heat a skillet over medium heat and shallow fry the meatballs until lightly browned on all sides. Remove the meatballs from the skillet and set aside.

4. In the same skillet, add sliced onion and stir until fragrant. Add Tomato ketchup, water, black vinegar, sugar or oyster sauce, and peas. Stir to combine.

5. Return the meatballs to the skillet and simmer in the sauce for about 5 minutes, until the meatballs are fully coated and the sauce has thickened slightly.

6. Serve hot and enjoy!
