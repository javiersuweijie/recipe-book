1. Pat the pork jowl dry with paper towel and cut into strips.

2. Mix all marinade ingredients, coat the pork, and marinate at least 2 hours. Meanwhile, mince the garlic and chop the shallot and chilies.

3. Heat oil in a pan and fry minced garlic until lightly golden. Remove and drain; reserve the garlic-infused oil.

4. Dust pork strips with rice flour. Shallow-fry in the same pan, about 3 minutes per side, until golden. Set aside.

5. Add a little garlic oil back to the pan. Sauté shallot with salt and five-spice powder. Return pork strips, toss, then add fried garlic and chilies. Stir-fry 1 minute and serve hot.
