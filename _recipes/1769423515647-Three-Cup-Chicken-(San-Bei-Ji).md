1. Heat sesame and vegetable oils in a wok over medium heat. Add ginger, garlic, and chili; let aromatics infuse for 2 minutes.

2. Increase heat to high. Add chicken in a single layer; sear until golden on both sides.

3. Stir in warm water, Shaoxing wine, dark soy sauce (start with 2 teaspoons), light soy sauce, and sugar. Cover, reduce heat to medium, and simmer 15 minutes (20 minutes for more tender chicken).

4. Remove lid, turn heat to high, and reduce sauce until it thickly coats the chicken, stirring to prevent burning.

5. Toss in Thai basil and/or scallions; fry 1 minute until wilted. Serve hot.
