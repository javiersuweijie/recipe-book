1. Prepare the ingredients: slice the onion thinly, cut the green onion into diagonal slices, and slice the semi-frozen beef into 3-inch pieces.

2. In a large frying pan, combine dashi, sake, mirin, soy sauce, and sugar. Stir to dissolve the sugar.

3. Add the sliced onions to the pan, spreading them out. Place the beef slices on top of the onions.

4. Cover the pan, turn the heat to medium, and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to low and cook, covered, for 3–4 minutes.

5. Skim off any scum and fat from the broth using a fine-mesh skimmer.

6. Sprinkle green onions on top, cover, and cook for an additional minute. Optionally, add beaten eggs now.

7. Divide cooked Japanese short-grain rice into donburi bowls. Drizzle some pan sauce over the rice, then spoon the beef and onion mixture on top. Garnish with pickled red ginger and serve.
