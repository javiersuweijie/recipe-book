title: Baked Ziti
description: A crowd-pleasing baked pasta with Italian sausage, creamy tomato sauce, and melted cheese—perfect for weeknights or potlucks.
servings: 8 to 10
prep_time: 40 minutes
cook_time: 50 minutes
ingredients:
  - 1 pound (450g) ziti noodles
  - 1½ pounds (680g) ground Italian sausage (sweet or spicy)
  - 4 cloves garlic, minced
  - 1 can (28oz/800g) crushed tomatoes
  - 1 teaspoon salt
  - 1½ teaspoons sugar
  - ¼ teaspoon crushed red-pepper flakes
  - 1 cup (240ml) heavy cream
  - ⅓ cup (33g) grated Pecorino Romano (or Parmigiano Reggiano), plus 3 tablespoons for topping
  - ⅓ cup chopped fresh basil, plus extra for garnish
  - 8oz (225g) whole-milk mozzarella, shredded (about 2 cups)
notes:
  - Whole-milk mozzarella gives the best melt; pre-shredded is fine.
  - Pasta should be very al dente—it finishes cooking in the oven.
  - Dish can be assembled, covered and refrigerated up to 2 days ahead, or frozen up to 3 months.

1. Bring a large pot of salted water to boil. Add ziti and cook 7 min (very al dente). Drain, return to pot; set aside.

2. Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C). In a large sauté pan over medium-high heat, crumble sausage; cook 5–6 min until browned. Transfer to a plate with a slotted spoon.

3. Discard all but 1 tablespoon fat (add olive oil if needed). Reduce heat to low; add garlic and cook 1 min without browning.

4. Stir in crushed tomatoes, salt, sugar and red-pepper flakes; simmer 10 min.

5. Add cream, ⅓ cup Pecorino Romano, basil and cooked sausage; stir to combine.

6. Pour sauce over pasta in pot; gently mix.

7. Spoon half the pasta into a 9 × 13-inch (23 × 33cm) baking dish. Top with half the mozzarella (1 cup/113g) and 1½ tablespoons Pecorino. Repeat layers.

8. Bake uncovered 15–20 min until cheese is melted and golden. Sprinkle with extra basil and serve.
