ingredients:
  - 4 oz (115 g) dried rice noodles, about 1/4” (5 cm)-wide
  - Chicken:
    - 8 oz (225 g) chicken breast, sliced thinly against the grain (or thigh)
    - 1 teaspoon soy sauce
  - Sauce:
    - 3 tablespoons brown sugar (or palm sugar)
    - 2 tablespoons tamarind puree (or tamarind paste)
    - 2 tablespoons oyster sauce (or vegetarian oyster sauce)
    - 2 tablespoons soy sauce
  - Stir Fry:
    - 1/2 head broccoli, cut into small bite-size florets
    - 4 tablespoons peanut oil (or vegetable oil)
    - 2 eggs, beaten
    - 4 cloves garlic, minced
    - 1 shallot, sliced
    - 1/2 carrot, sliced
    - 5 green onions, sliced into 1” (2.5 cm) pieces
    - 1 long red pepper, sliced (or bird eye pepper if preferred spicy)
    - 1 1/2 cups mung bean sprouts, and extra for garnish
    - 3 tablespoons peanuts, coarsely chopped
    - 1 lime, sliced into wedges for garnish
notes:
  - If you prefer a more authentic taste, use 2 tablespoons of fish sauce to replace the 2 tablespoons of oyster sauce and 2 tablespoons of soy sauce.
  - If you want to make this dish vegan or vegetarian, use vegetarian oyster sauce with tofu.
  - If you use chicken breast, you can also add 1 teaspoon cornstarch to the mix to keep the chicken tender.

1. Fully submerge the noodles in room temperature water for 30 to 40 minutes, until they are soft enough to wrap around your fingers without breaking apart, but not quite soft enough that you can bite into them. Drain and set aside.

2. Combine the chicken pieces and soy sauce in a medium-sized bowl. Mix with your hands until the chicken is evenly coated. Let marinate while preparing the other ingredients.

3. Combine the sauce ingredients and mix until the sugar is fully dissolved.

4. Add 1/4 cup water to a large skillet and heat over medium-high heat until simmering. Add the broccoli florets and cover. Steam for 40 seconds to 1 minute, until al dente. Transfer the broccoli to a plate. Wipe the pan clean with paper towels.

5. Add 1 tablespoon of oil to the same skillet. Add the chicken pieces with as little overlapping as possible. Cook without moving until the bottom turns golden brown. Turn to the other side, for 30 seconds or so, until the bottom just turns golden. Transfer to a plate and set aside.

6. Add 1 tablespoon of oil and pour in the beaten eggs. Let cook without moving until the bottom sets, then start to scramble lightly, until the eggs are almost cooked. Transfer the eggs to the plate with the chicken.

7. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil, the garlic, shallots, and carrot into the same pan. Cook and stir for 1 minute to release the fragrance.

8. Add the noodles. Stir a few times to mix everything together. Pour in the sauce. Cook and stir until the sauce is mostly absorbed.

9. Add back the cooked chicken, eggs, and broccoli. Stir a few times to mix well.

10. Add the green onion, pepper, and bean sprouts. Toss for another 30 seconds, until the vegetables are just wilted. Carefully taste a noodle. If it’s still too tough, add a splash of water and stir to mix well. Cook for another 1 to 2 minutes until the noodles reach the texture you prefer.

11. Garnish with the remaining bean sprouts, peanuts, and some wedges of lime. Serve hot as a main dish.
