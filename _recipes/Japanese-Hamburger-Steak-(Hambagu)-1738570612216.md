servings: 4
prep_time: 30 minutes
cook_time: 20 minutes
ingredients:
  - ½ onion (5 oz, 142 g)
  - 1 Tbsp neutral oil
  - ¾ lb ground beef and pork combination (beef-to-pork ratio of 2:1 or 3:1)
  - ½ tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt
  - Freshly ground black pepper
  - ½ tsp nutmeg
  - ⅓ cup panko (Japanese breadcrumbs)
  - 2 Tbsp milk
  - 1 large egg (50 g each without shell)
  - 1 Tbsp neutral oil for cooking
  - 3 Tbsp red wine (or substitute with beef/chicken stock)
  - 1 Tbsp unsalted butter
  - 3 Tbsp ketchup
  - 3 Tbsp tonkatsu sauce (or substitute with Worcestershire sauce and sugar)
  - 3 Tbsp water
notes: |
  - For a juicier patty, use a combination of beef and pork.
  - Red wine can be substituted with beef or chicken stock.
  - Letting the patties rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes is crucial for solidifying fats and combining flavors.

1. Finely mince the onion using the mijingiri cutting technique and sauté until tender. Let cool.
2. In a bowl, combine the cooled onion, ground beef and pork, salt, pepper, nutmeg, panko, milk, and egg. Mix until sticky and pale.
3. Divide the mixture into 4 portions. Toss each portion between hands to release air, shape into oval patties, and refrigerate for 30 minutes.
4. Heat a pan with oil, sear the patties for 3 minutes per side, then add red wine, cover, and cook on low for 5-7 minutes until fully cooked.
5. Remove patties and make the sauce in the same pan. Add butter, ketchup, tonkatsu sauce, red wine, and water. Simmer until thickened.
6. Serve the patties with the red wine reduction sauce and optional sides like steamed rice, miso soup, or vegetables.
