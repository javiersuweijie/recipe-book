title: Cantonese Steamed Fish
description: A traditional and simple Cantonese dish that can be prepared in just 20 minutes, perfect for a quick and delicious meal.
servings: 2
prep_time: 5 minutes
cook_time: 15 minutes
ingredients:
  - 2 scallions
  - 2 tablespoons ginger
  - 1 small bunch cilantro
  - 1 Â½ tablespoons light soy sauce (or seasoned soy sauce)
  - 1/8 teaspoon salt
  - 1/8 teaspoon sugar
  - 2 tablespoons hot water
  - 10 ounce fillet of delicate white fish (such as sea bass, grey sole, flounder, fluke, tilapia, or haddock)
  - 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
notes: |
  - Any delicate white fish works well for this recipe.
  - The sauce ingredients can be adjusted based on personal preference.

1. Cut the scallions into 2-inch lengths, then halve and julienne them thinly. Slice the ginger into thin strips and julienne them. Roughly chop the cilantro and set aside 1/3 of each aromatic for later use.

2. In a small bowl, combine soy sauce, salt, sugar, and hot water. Stir until the salt and sugar dissolve, then set aside.

3. Prepare your steaming setup. Use a wok, deep skillet, or pot with a lid. Place a metal rack or an empty tuna can at the bottom and add 1-2 inches of water. Bring to a boil.

4. Rinse the fish fillet and place it on a heat-proof plate that fits your steamer. Position the plate in the steamer, cover, and adjust the heat to medium. Steam for 7-10 minutes, or 4-5 minutes for thin fillets, until a butter knife pierces the thickest part easily.

5. While the fish cooks, heat 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil in a wok or saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the remaining 2/3 of the ginger and fry for 1 minute.

6. Add the white parts of the scallions and cook for 30 seconds, then add the remaining scallions and cilantro. The mixture should sizzle.

7. Pour in the soy sauce mixture and bring to a bubble. Cook until the scallions and cilantro are slightly wilted, about 30 seconds.

8. Pour the sauce over the steamed fish. If desired, add the reserved raw aromatics and pour a tablespoon of hot oil over them for extra flavor.

9. Serve immediately with steamed white rice.
