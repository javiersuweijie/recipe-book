1. Marinate the minced pork with sugar, light soy sauce, potato starch, and sesame oil. Let it sit for a few minutes to allow the flavors to meld.

2. Prepare the tofu by cutting it into 1/2 inch cubes and draining excess liquid in a colander.

3. Drain the liquid from the canned button mushrooms and set aside.

4. Heat a little oil in a wok over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and saut√© until fragrant.

5. Add the marinated minced pork to the wok, breaking it up into smaller bits as it cooks.

6. Add the mushrooms to the wok and toss them together with the pork.

7. Stir in the oyster sauce and mix well with the pork and mushrooms. Cook for about 1 minute.

8. Add 200ml of water to the wok and bring the mixture to a simmer.

9. Carefully add the tofu cubes to the wok. Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer and let cook for a few minutes until the tofu is heated through.

10. Taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary. Thicken the sauce slightly by adding a potato or corn starch slurry.

11. Dish up, garnish with chopped spring onion, and serve hot with rice.
