title: Air Fried Honey Lemon Chicken
description: A crispy, tangy-sweet chicken dish with minimal oil, perfect as an appetizer or with rice
servings: 3-4
prep_time: 15 minutes + 1 hour marinating
cook_time: 10 minutes
ingredients:
  - "Marinade":
    - 340g boneless chicken leg, bite-sized (chicken breast or thigh works too)
    - 1 tsp salt
    - 2 tbsp light soy sauce (30ml)
    - 1 tbsp fresh ginger juice (grate young ginger and squeeze)
    - Few dashes white pepper
    - 1 egg white (optional, for better coating adhesion)
    - 2 tbsp cornflour/cornstarch (plus extra for coating)
  - "Sauce":
    - 100ml water
    - 2 tbsp sugar
    - 0.5 tsp salt
    - Juice from ½ lemon
    - 1 tsp lemon zest
    - 1 tbsp honey (added last, optional)
notes:
  - You can substitute orange juice and zest for a citrus twist
  - Resting the floured chicken ensures the coating doesn't flake off during frying
  - Oil spray promotes uniform browning without deep-frying's grease

1. Marinate the chicken by combining bite-sized chicken pieces with salt, light soy sauce, ginger juice, white pepper, egg white (if using), and 2 tbsp cornflour in a bowl. Mix well and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.

2. After marinating, coat pieces in additional cornflour by hand-mixing and squeezing gently to create a thick layer. Shake off excess and rest for 10-15 minutes so the coating adheres firmly.

3. Spray the coated chicken lightly with oil on both sides for even browning.

4. Preheat air fryer to 200°C (400°F). Arrange chicken in a single layer without overlapping and cook for 10 minutes until golden. Work in batches if needed.

5. Meanwhile, prepare the sauce by heating water, sugar, and salt in a pan until dissolved. Stir in lemon juice and zest over high heat, reducing until it coats a spoon thickly with big bubbles forming.

6. Remove sauce from heat and mix in honey. Toss the fried chicken in the glossy sauce for a sweet-sour finish.
