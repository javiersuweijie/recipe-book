1. Prepare all ingredients as described: slice pork belly, scrape gobo, peel and slice taro, onion, daikon, carrot, and konnyaku. Clean konnyaku with salt and cook briefly. Slice aburaage and green onion for garnish.

2. Heat sesame oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add pork belly and stir-fry until no longer pink. Add onion and stir-fry until translucent.

3. Add daikon and carrot slices, then gobo and taro. Stir to coat with oil.

4. Add konnyaku, aburaage, negi, and dashi. Cover and bring to a boil, skimming off scum. Simmer until vegetables are tender, about 10–15 minutes.

5. Dissolve miso into the soup, starting with a small amount and adjusting to taste. Add grated ginger.

6. Tear tofu into small pieces and add to the soup. Simmer gently without boiling.

7. Serve hot in miso soup bowls, garnished with green onion and shichimi togarashi if desired.
