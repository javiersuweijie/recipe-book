1. Make the Aspic: Preheat oven to 200C (180C fan). Place chicken in an oven-proof pot or tray with scallions and ginger. Cover tightly and roast for 1 hour. Cool covered. Pour extracted liquid into a container and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or until the aspic sets (approx. 250 g). Reserve the chicken for other dishes.

2. Prepare the Dough: In a bowl, add hot water to the flour and mix. Gradually add tap water and knead into a dough. Rest for 10 minutes, covered. Knead again until smooth, then let it rest for 30-60 minutes until soft.

3. Mix the Filling: Combine minced pork with all filling seasonings. Remove chicken fat from the set aspic, break it into tiny pieces, and mix into the pork.

4. Chill the Filling: Refrigerate the filling for at least 30 minutes and keep it cold until assembling.

5. Roll the Wrappers: Roll the dough into a rope and divide it into 20 equal pieces. Press each piece into a disc and keep them covered. Using a roll-and-turn technique, roll each disc into a ~12 cm wrapper, dusting with flour or cornstarch as needed. Assemble dumplings one by one; avoid stockpiling wrappers.

6. Assemble the Dumplings: Place approximately 35 g of filling in the center of each wrapper. Pleat the edges 15-20 times to seal, leaving the center open or sealed as preferred.

7. Steam the Dumplings: Line a steamer basket with parchment paper or cut parchment squares. Place dumplings in the basket with at least 3 cm spacing between them.

8. Cook: Steam over boiling water on medium-low heat for 8 minutes (or 10 minutes if you have more than 10 dumplings).

9. Serve and Eat: Serve the dumplings in the steamer basket. To eat, place a dumpling on a spoon, carefully poke a small hole to release and slurp the soup before eating the wrapper and filling. Dip in the prepared vinegar and ginger sauce.
