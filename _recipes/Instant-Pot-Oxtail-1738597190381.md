servings: 6
prep_time: 15 minutes
cook_time: 1 hour 50 minutes
ingredients:
  - 3.5 - 4 pounds (1766g) oxtails
  - 1 (250g) large onion, sliced
  - 1 (466g) large russet potato, quartered
  - 3 (296g) medium carrots, cut in 1 ½ inch (4cm) chunks
  - 8 (30g) garlic cloves, roughly chopped
  - ¼ cup (63ml) balsamic vinegar
  - 1.5 tablespoon (22.5ml) regular soy sauce
  - 1 tablespoon (15ml) fish sauce
  - 1 tablespoon (15ml) olive oil
  - 3 tablespoons (49g) tomato paste
  - 2 bay leaves
  - A pinch of dried oregano
  - A pinch of dried thyme
  - 1 cup (250ml) unsalted chicken stock or high-quality beef stock
notes: |
  - Brown the oxtails in the Instant Pot using the "Sauté More" function before cooking.
  - For older Instant Pot versions, press "Saute" then "Adjust" to select "More" mode.
  - Brown the larger pieces of oxtails to save time from browning a second batch.

1. Brown the oxtails in the Instant Pot using the "Sauté More" function. Heat the pot until it displays "HOT," then add olive oil and season the oxtails with salt and black pepper. Brown each side for 5 minutes.

2. Set aside the browned oxtails. Add sliced onions and sauté for 2 minutes. Add tomato paste, bay leaves, oregano, thyme, and garlic, then sauté for another 3 minutes.

3. Deglaze the pot with unsalted stock, scrubbing the flavorful brown bits off the bottom.

4. Add balsamic vinegar, soy sauce, and fish sauce to the pot. Layer the carrots and potatoes on top of the oxtails. Close the lid, set the Venting Knob to "Sealing," and pressure cook at high pressure for 40 minutes with a natural release of 20 minutes.

5. After cooking, carefully remove the oxtails and half the carrots. Simmer the sauce and mash the remaining carrots and potatoes to thicken it. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

6. Return the oxtails to the sauce and let them sit for 10–15 minutes before serving. Serve immediately or the next day for enhanced flavor.
