title: Air Fryer Crispy Pork Belly
description: Extra-crispy Chinese-style roast pork belly made fast in the air fryer—no 48-hour prep required
servings: 12
prep_time: 10 minutes
cook_time: 1 hour
total_time: 1 hour 10 minutes
ingredients:
  - 3 pounds (1.5 kg) pork belly, skin-on, boneless, center-cut
  - "Seasoning Paste":
    - ½ tablespoon kosher salt
    - ½ tablespoon white pepper (5 g)
    - ½ tablespoon five-spice powder (5 g)
    - ½ tablespoon sugar (6 g)
    - ½ tablespoon Shaoxing wine (7 ml)
  - 1 cup kosher salt (for crust)
  - 1 tablespoon distilled white vinegar (15 ml)
  - 1 tablespoon neutral oil (15 ml)
notes:
  - Ask your butcher for an even, symmetrical slab with a thin white fat layer between the meat.
  - Pierce the skin only—do not cut into the meat.
  - Dry the skin thoroughly; moisture prevents puffing.
  - Start checking skin crispness after 20 min at 400°F; tent any hot spots with foil.
  - Rest 5–10 min before slicing so juices re-absorb.

1. Score the meat side of the pork belly with ½-inch deep cuts.  
2. Stir together kosher salt, white pepper, five-spice, sugar, and Shaoxing wine to form a paste. Rub evenly over the meat, keeping the skin clean.  
3. Pat the skin completely dry. Use a skewer or sharp knife to poke holes across the skin (only through skin/fat, not into meat). Trim the slab so it fits your air-fryer basket.  
4. Make a foil “frame” around the pork, leaving ½-inch walls to hold salt. Brush vinegar over the skin, then cover the skin entirely with the 1 cup kosher salt.  
5. Air-fry at 250°F (120°C) for 30 min until the salt crust is dry.  
6. Remove and brush off all salt. Pat skin dry again, then lightly brush with oil.  
7. Return to air-fryer at 400°F (200°C) for 30–40 min, checking at 20 min and every 5 min thereafter, until skin is puffed and deeply golden. Tent any burning spots with foil.  
8. Rest 5–10 min, then slice and serve.
