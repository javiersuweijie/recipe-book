1. Soak peanuts in boiling water for about 30 minutes. Discard the soaking water.
2. Blanch pork ribs in a small pot of boiling water for about 5 minutes to remove impurities.
3. While waiting for the pork ribs, wash, peel, and cut the lotus root into 1 cm slices or irregular bite-sized pieces.
4. Remove the pork ribs from the water and set aside.
5. In a large soup pot, add all the ingredients, including the prepared lotus root, pork ribs, peanuts, carrot, dried cuttlefish (if using), dried scallops (if using), and dried red dates.
6. Pour in enough water to cover all ingredients by about 1 to 1-2 inches.
7. Bring the soup to a boil, then reduce the heat to the lowest setting and let it simmer for 2 to 3 hours, until the meat is very tender.
8. Season the soup with salt to taste, then serve hot.
