1. Sprinkle Sake (Rice Wine) and Salt over Salmon Fillets, and set aside.

2. Wash the rice by stirring it thoroughly in water and drain. Repeat this a few more times, then drain well. Place the rice into the rice cooker’s inner pot.

3. Add Chicken Stock (or stock of your choice) and Soy Sauce to the rice, and gently stir. Add grated Carrot, Butter, Corn Kernels, and some Black Pepper, then place the Salmon on top.

4. Press the ‘COOK’ button to start cooking. When the rice is cooked, let it steam for 10 minutes.

5. Remove the Salmon, discard the skin and bones, and return the salmon to the rice. Mix gently, breaking up the Salmon coarsely.

6. Sprinkle with finely chopped Parsley and Black Pepper. Drizzle with extra Soy Sauce if desired, and enjoy.
