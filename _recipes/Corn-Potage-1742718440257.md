1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Place corn cobs in and cook for 5-8 minutes, until corn is vibrant in colour. Drain the corn and then once cooled, cut the corn off the cob by running a knife down the cob.

2. Add the corn and soy milk to a high speed blender and blend for about 1 minute on high until creamy.

3. Place a fine mesh sieve over a large bowl or pot and pour half of the corn soup in. Use a spatula to help speed up the process. Pour the other half of the soup and repeat.

4. Serve the soup at room temperature or heat on the stove over a low temperature. If serving cold, chill in the fridge for about 1 hour. Garnish with fresh parsley, croutons or soy cream and enjoy!
