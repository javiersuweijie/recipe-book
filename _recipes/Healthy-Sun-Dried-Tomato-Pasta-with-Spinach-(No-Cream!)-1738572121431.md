servings: 4
prep_time: 5 minutes
cook_time: 25 minutes
ingredients:
  - 8 oz penne pasta
  - 2 tbsp olive oil
  - 1 tbsp sun-dried tomato oil (from the jar)
  - 3 garlic cloves, minced
  - 1/3 cup jarred sun-dried tomatoes, chopped finely
  - 1 tsp oregano
  - 1 tbsp tomato paste
  - 1/2 cup chicken broth
  - 1/3 cup Greek yogurt (2% fat)
  - 1/3 cup Parmesan cheese, freshly grated
  - 1/4 cup pasta water
  - 1 cup spinach, roughly chopped
  - 1 tbsp fresh basil, finely chopped
  - Salt and pepper to taste
notes: |
  - For the best results, use freshly grated Parmesan cheese as pre-grated cheese may not melt properly.
  - When adding Greek yogurt, ensure the heat is low to prevent curdling.

1. Cook the penne pasta according to package instructions until al dente. Reserve 1/4 cup of pasta water before draining.
2. In a large skillet, heat olive oil and sun-dried tomato oil over medium heat. Add minced garlic, sun-dried tomatoes, oregano, salt, and pepper. Sauté for 2-3 minutes until fragrant.
3. Stir in tomato paste and sauté for about 5 minutes to caramelize and deepen the flavor.
4. Add chicken broth to the skillet, bringing it to a simmer. Let it cook for 3-5 minutes until the sauce begins to thicken.
5. Reduce heat to low. Stir in Greek yogurt, Parmesan cheese, and reserved pasta water until smooth and well combined.
6. Add chopped spinach to the skillet, stirring until wilted.
7. Toss cooked pasta into the skillet, coating it thoroughly with the sauce.
8. Garnish with fresh basil, season with salt and pepper to taste, and serve immediately.
