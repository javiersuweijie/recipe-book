1. In a small bowl, stir together balsamic vinegar, water, lemon juice, and brown sugar until well combined.

2. Pat the salmon fillets dry with paper towels and season generously with salt and freshly ground black pepper.

3. Heat olive oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Once hot, increase the heat to high and carefully place the salmon fillets skin side up. Sear until well browned, about 4 minutes.

4. Flip the salmon over and sear for an additional 3 to 4 minutes, until just cooked through.

5. Transfer the salmon to plates and carefully pour the vinegar mixture into the skillet. The liquid will bubble vigorously, so be cautious.

6. Simmer the glaze, stirring occasionally, until it thickens and reduces to about 1/3 cup, which should take about 2 minutes.

7. Spoon the balsamic glaze over the salmon fillets and serve immediately.
