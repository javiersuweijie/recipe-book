notes: |
  - For smaller, more flavorful ribs, have the butcher cut the ribs crosswise into shorter slabs, then cut into individual sections at home.
  - To thicken the sauce, use a cornstarch slurry or reduce the sauce by cooking it longer.
  - Optional vegetables can be added at the end for a one-pan meal.

instructions:
1. Blanch the pork ribs in a large pot of cold water. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce to medium heat. Boil for 5 minutes, skimming foam with a spoon.
2. Add ginger, green onion, nutmeg, star anise, cloves, and cooking wine. Simmer on low heat, covered, for 40 minutes, stirring occasionally.
3. Stir in light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, sugar, and salt. Add red fermented bean curd to a small bowl with hot broth, smash until dissolved, then pour back into the pot. Simmer, uncovered, for another 40-50 minutes until pork is tender.
4. Add optional vegetables and continue simmering for 15 minutes until tender.
5. Mix cornstarch and 1/3 cup water in a bowl. Add half the slurry to the pot, stirring well. Add more if needed to thicken the sauce.
6. Serve with steamed white rice or noodles.

Store the pork ribs in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 1 week or freeze for up to 1 month.
