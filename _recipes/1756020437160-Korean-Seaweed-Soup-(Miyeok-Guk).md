1. Soak the dried seaweed in cold water for 5 to 10 minutes. Drain and rinse in running water, then squeeze out excess water. If needed, cut into little finger lengths and set aside.

2. In a small bowl, combine sliced beef, salt, and pepper. Mix well and set aside.

3. Heat a medium pot over medium heat for about 20 seconds. Add sesame oil, seaweed, and beef. Stir until beef is partly cooked, about 2 minutes.

4. Add soy sauce, garlic, and water. Cover the pot and boil over medium to medium-high heat until meat is fully cooked, about 10 to 15 minutes. Adjust salt to taste.

5. Serve warm with steamed rice and other Korean side dishes.
