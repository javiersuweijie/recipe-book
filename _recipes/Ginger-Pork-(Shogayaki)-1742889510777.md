  - For the Shogayaki:
    - ¾ lb (340 g) thinly sliced pork loin
    - 1 Tbsp (15 ml) sake
    - 1 Tbsp (15 g) all-purpose flour (optional)
    - 1-2 Tbsp (15-30 ml) neutral oil
    - Freshly ground black pepper (optional)

  - If your pork slices are thicker than ⅛ inch (3 mm), cut slits on the connective tissue to prevent curling.
  - Dusting with flour helps retain juices in the meat.
  - Adjust the amount of grated ginger to your taste.

1. In a small bowl, combine soy sauce, mirin, sake, and sugar for the ginger sauce. Add half of the ginger juice and as much grated ginger as desired. Mix well.

2. Grate ½ onion until you get 1 Tbsp of grated onion with juice. Add this to the ginger sauce and mix.

3. Prepare the pork slices. If necessary, cut slits on the connective tissue to prevent curling. Sprinkle with the remaining ginger juice and sake. Let marinate for 5 minutes.

4. Lightly dust the pork slices with flour if needed. Heat a large frying pan over medium-high heat and add 1-2 Tbsp of neutral oil. Cook the pork slices in batches until golden brown, then transfer to a plate.

5. In the same pan, add more oil if necessary and sauté the remaining onion slices until golden brown, about 6-8 minutes.

6. Return the pork to the pan with the onions. Pour in the ginger sauce and bring to a simmer. Spoon the sauce over the pork for about 2 minutes. Season with black pepper if desired.

7. Once the sauce has thickened, remove from heat. Serve the Ginger Pork with shredded cabbage or a salad of your choice.
