1. Rinse the rice in a fine-mesh sieve under cold water until the water runs clear; set aside to drain.

2. Warm the olive oil in a medium saucepan or deep skillet over medium heat. Add the diced onion and bell pepper; sauté 3–5 minutes until the onion is soft and translucent.

3. Stir in the minced garlic and grated turmeric; cook 1 minute until fragrant.

4. Add the drained rice, salt, and a few grinds of black pepper; toss for 1 minute so every grain is coated in the spiced oil.

5. Pour in the water or broth. Bring to a gentle boil, then cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer 15–18 minutes, until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is tender.

6. Remove from heat, fluff with a fork, and fold in the frozen peas/carrots and chopped spinach. Cover again and let steam 10–15 minutes.

7. Taste, adjust salt and pepper, sprinkle with cilantro, and serve.
