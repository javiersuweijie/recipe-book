ingredients:
  - 4 salmon fillets, about 3–4 oz each

1. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium to high heat. Season both sides of salmon with salt and pepper. Add salmon to skillet and cook 1 to 2 minutes per side, until golden brown.

2. While the salmon is cooking, whisk together honey, vinegar, and red pepper flakes in a small bowl. Add vinegar mixture to skillet and simmer until fish is fork-tender and liquid reduces and thickens, about 5 minutes. For a thicker, reduced sauce, simmer for 5 to 10 additional minutes. You may need to remove the salmon during this process to prevent overcooking.

3. Plate salmon and serve with sides of your choice.
