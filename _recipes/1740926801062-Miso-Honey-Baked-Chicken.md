1. **Marinate Chicken**: In a bowl, mix together the marinade ingredients (water, garlic, miso, soy sauce, sesame oil, and honey). Coat the chicken thighs evenly and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight.

2. **Prep Veggies**: Heat olive oil in a pan and stir-fry the shallots, leek, and daikon until slightly soft. Set aside.

3. **Bake #1**: Place the marinated chicken skin-side up in a casserole dish. Bake in a preheated oven at 180°C (350°F) for 20 minutes.

4. **Glaze**: While baking, mix 1 tbsp (15g) honey with 1 tbsp (15ml) water to make the glaze.

5. **Bake #2**: After 20 minutes, brush the glaze evenly over the chicken. Increase the oven temperature to 200°C (400°F) and bake for 10 minutes.

6. **Final Touch**: If needed, add more glaze and bake for an additional 5 minutes, or until the chicken is golden and crispy.

7. **Serve**: Remove from the oven and serve the chicken with the roasted vegetables.
